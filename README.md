# How I generated the longest ever xmr vanity address
## Preface
I became interested in vanity addresses when I was browsing around on the dark web. Tor's .onion links are generated as a SHA1 hash of the private key. But I noticed that most of the onion services I visited contained the name of the service inside of the onion address. For example, duckduckgo provides an onion service at: https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion. I figured that these addresses probably had a small field at the beginning for a name followed by relevant cryptographic data. To my suprise, there was no such field, and these addresses are nearly indistingishable from being totally random, being generated as a SHA-1 hash of the private key for the serice. At the same time, I was learning about proof-of-work blockchains, and I realized the process to create one of these onion addresses was no different than the process of generating cryptographic proof-of-work as described in the Bitcoin whitepaper. I have no plans to run an onion service, but I thought it might be cool to have a stylized BTC, LTC, or XMR address. Such addresses, I learned, are called "vanity addresses"

## Monero addresses
Monero addresses are somewhat unique compared to other crypto addresses, because they consist of 2 keys instead of just 1: these keys are called the **public view key** and the **public spend key** and are derived from the private spend and view key using a cryptographic elliptic curve algorithm. After finding out monero addresses are actually 2 keys, I realized that I could generate significantly longer vanity addresses at the junction between these 2 keys. This would allow me to easily beat any existing length records for vanity addresses, while unfortunately precluding vanity strings at the beginning of the address where they are most visible. Generating 2 halves of the vanity address seperately effectively square roots the search space, making searches that would normally take hundreds of thousands of years on average possible to do in just minutes.
